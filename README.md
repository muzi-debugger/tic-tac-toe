This is a tic-tac-toe application that allows two players to play a game of Xs and Os on the web browser. The application stores the state of a player's last move so as to not alter the game.
Every player gets a turn after the previous player has played their turn and a winner is determined when a line of Xs or Os are played diagonally or horizontally. To start the application
clone the repo, run ``npm install`` then run ``npm start`` this starts the application and launches the application on the browser. Players can now play the game. Let the games begin!
